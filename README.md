## Why FrenchTTS?

Finding a good French TTS in 2026 is surprisingly painful.

Most free solutions sound robotic, rely on outdated speech engines, or require you to paste text into a web interface and manually download the output. Paid alternatives _(ElevenLabs, Azure, Google Cloud)_ do sound great — but they all require an API key, a credit card, and start billing once you exceed a free tier.

On the open-source side, offline models like Kokoro or XTTS exist, but they demand a GPU, several GB of model weights, and non-trivial setup just to get started.

**FrenchTTS bridges that gap.** It uses Microsoft Edge's neural TTS engine — the same one powering the Read Aloud feature built into Edge browser — through the `edge-tts` library. No account, no key, no install beyond `pip`. The voices are genuinely neural-quality, indistinguishable from a paid service for most use cases, and the latency is low enough for real-time roleplay.

The app wraps it in a clean dark-mode desktop UI with audio device routing, so you can pipe the output directly into voicechat (Discord, FiveM, TeamSpeak, ...) via VB-Cable without touching any config file or third-party tool.

## Features

- **Neural voices** — 8 French voices (France, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland) streamed from Microsoft Edge, no key required
- **Device selector** — route audio to any output, auto-detects VB-Cable
- **Monitor output** — optionally hear the TTS in your headphones simultaneously on a second device
- **Voice controls** — adjustable speed, volume, and pitch
- **Input history** — navigate previous texts with `↑` / `↓` (shell-style)
- **Replay** — one-click or configurable hotkey (default `F2`) replays the last speech
- **Global hotkeys** — Replay, Stop, and STT work even when the app is not focused
- **STT pipeline** — mic → VAD → faster-whisper → TTS, hands-free dictation (disabled by default)
  - Energy-based VAD: starts recording automatically when you speak, stops on silence
  - Configurable keybind (default `F1`) shown on the button
  - Auto-restart mode: re-activates the mic after each TTS playback
  - Optional tray notification showing the transcribed text
- **System tray** — closing the window hides to tray (balloon notification confirms); restores on double-click; quit via tray menu
- **Acrylic blur** — Windows 10/11 native background blur with adjustable opacity
- **Resource controls** _(Performances)_ — CPU core throttle (affinity mask), Windows process priority (Normal / Below Normal / Idle), and RAM working-set soft cap; all live, all saved to config
- **Persistent config** — all settings and history saved in `%APPDATA%\UseVoice\FrenchTTS`; atomic writes prevent corruption on crash
- **Auto-updater** — checks GitHub Releases at launch, downloads `FrenchTTSInstaller.exe`, self-replaces silently; versioned by commit SHA (`prod-XXXXXXX`)
- **Installer** — dark-themed CTk installer with progress steps; creates Desktop shortcut, Start Menu folder, and `FrenchTTSUninstaller.exe`
- **Uninstaller** — removes app, config, STT models, shortcuts, and Start Menu entries
- **What's New dialog** — shown once after each update with the release changelog
- **Buildable as `.exe`** — 3-step PyInstaller build via `build.bat`

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11
- Python 3.10+
- Internet connection (TTS voices stream from Microsoft's servers; STT runs fully offline)

---

## Quick start

##### Dev mode (no updater splash)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UseVoice/FrenchTTS.git
cd FrenchTTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Or use the helper scripts at the project root:

| Script                  | What it does                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `setup.bat`             | Install all pip dependencies                      |
| `launch - dev.bat`      | Run `python main.py` directly, no updater splash  |
| `launch - update.bat`   | Run with `--update` flag to simulate an update    |
| `launch - installer.bat`| Test the installer or uninstaller interactively   |

---

## Build as `.exe`

```bash
build.bat
```

Three-step build — each artifact is a prerequisite for the next:

| Step | Output | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| 1 | `dist\FrenchTTS.exe` | Main app; git SHA injected as build ID |
| 2 | `dist\FrenchTTSUninstaller.exe` | Tiny stdlib-only uninstaller |
| 3 | `installer\dist\FrenchTTSInstaller.exe` | Bundles both exes; this is the release asset |

To publish a release, trigger the **Build & Release** workflow manually from the GitHub Actions UI. It builds all three artifacts, tags the release `prod-<sha>`, and attaches `FrenchTTSInstaller.exe` as the only release asset.

Write `versions/<sha>.md` beforehand if you want a custom What's New changelog (auto-generated otherwise from conventional commits).

---

## Usage

| Action                  | How                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Speak text              | Type → `Enter` or click **Parler**                           |
| Insert newline          | `Shift + Enter`                                              |
| Stop playback           | **Arrêter** or configured hotkey (default `F3`)              |
| Replay last audio       | **Redire (F2)** or configured hotkey (default `F2`)          |
| Navigate history        | `↑` / `↓` in the text box                                   |
| Open settings           | **⚙ Paramètres**                                            |
| Hide to tray            | Click the window's close button (×)                          |
| Quit                    | Right-click the tray icon → **Quitter**                      |
| Start / stop STT        | **🎙 STT (F1)** button or configured hotkey (default `F1`)  |

> **Global hotkeys** (Replay, Stop, STT) fire even when the app is minimized or not focused.

---

## STT — Speech-to-Text

> **STT is disabled by default.** Enable it in **⚙ Paramètres → STT — Reconnaissance vocale → Activer**.

STT uses [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (Whisper `small` model, CPU, int8) for offline French transcription.

**Flow:** press the STT button (or `F1`) → speak → silence is detected automatically → text is transcribed → TTS plays it back.

**First use:** the Whisper model (~460 MB) is downloaded once to `%APPDATA%\UseVoice\FrenchTTS\stt_models` and cached for all future sessions.

**Settings:**

| Option             | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Activer            | Show/hide the STT button                                                    |
| Touche STT         | Keybind to toggle listening (default `F1`)                                  |
| Redémarrage auto   | Automatically re-activates the mic after each TTS playback                  |
| Notif. texte       | Show a tray balloon with the transcribed text (title: "STT — Retranscription") |
| Microphone         | Input device for VAD/transcription                                          |

---

## Performances (resource management)

Available in **⚙ Paramètres → Performances**.

| Setting | Description | Default |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Cœurs CPU** | Limits the process to N logical CPUs via `SetProcessAffinityMask`. Slider from 1 to the number of logical CPUs on your machine. | 75 % of cores |
| **Priorité CPU** | Windows process priority class — `Normale`, `En dessous de la normale`, or `Basse (arrière-plan)`. Lower values reduce CPU scheduler share and may noticeably slow TTS generation. | Normale |
| **RAM max** | Soft working-set cap in MB via `SetProcessWorkingSetSizeEx`. Windows will page out memory above this limit when the system is under pressure. 4096 MB = Illimité (no cap). | 1024 MB |

All three settings are applied immediately on change and persisted to `config.json`.

---

## VB-Cable setup

Example with [Discord](https://discord.com):

1. Install [VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
2. In FrenchTTS → **⚙ Paramètres → Sortie TTS** → `CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`
3. In Discord → Settings → Voice → **Input Device** → `CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`

To also hear the output in your own headphones, enable **Casque** in settings and select your headphone device.

---

## Installation

Download `FrenchTTSInstaller.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/UseVoice/FrenchTTS/releases/latest) and run it.

The installer:
- Extracts `FrenchTTS.exe` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UseVoice\FrenchTTS\`
- Creates a Desktop shortcut
- Creates a **Start Menu** folder (`FrenchTTS`) with shortcuts for the app and the uninstaller
- Extracts `FrenchTTSUninstaller.exe` alongside the app

To uninstall, run **Désinstaller FrenchTTS** from the Start Menu (or `FrenchTTSUninstaller.exe` directly). It removes the app, all configuration, STT models, and shortcuts.
